```

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 19.2 with TypeScript
- Vite for blazing-fast development
- Tailwind CSS 4.x for styling
- Radix UI components
- Sonner for toast notifications
- Three.js for 3D visualizations

**Backend:**
- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI for high-performance API
- Uvicorn ASGI server
- httpx for async HTTP requests
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Ngrok for webhook tunneling
- Make.com for automation workflows

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** with `uv` package manager
- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)
- **Make.com account** (for webhook integrations)
- **Ngrok account** (optional, for remote webhooks)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/revel8.git
   cd revel8
   ```

2. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   uv run python main.py
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Start the frontend client** (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The client will start on `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Docker Deployment

For production deployment using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start both the client (port 3000) and server (port 8000) in containers.

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Target Selection

1. Navigate to the home page
2. Search for a target company using the intelligent search powered by Clearbit
3. Select your target organization
4. The system will automatically trigger the OSINT engine

### 2. Dashboard Overview

Once a target is selected, you'll access the main dashboard with four key tabs:

#### **Overview Tab**
- Real-time OSINT progress tracking
- Company profile summary
- Quick stats on vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- Completion percentage

#### **OSINT Engine Tab**
- **Company Profile**: Detailed organization information (industry, revenue, employee count)
- **Technology Stack**: Infrastructure and software technologies in use
- **Social Media Presence**: Active social platforms and engagement metrics
- **Key Personnel**: High-value targets with risk levels and contact information
- **Vulnerabilities**: Security weaknesses with severity ratings and exploitability scores
- **Attack Vectors**: Identified attack channels with success rate predictions

#### **Google Meet Attack Tab**
- Configure social engineering campaigns
- Target selection from identified personnel
- Attack timing and parameters
- Real-time execution monitoring

#### **Execute Attack Tab**
- Launch configured attacks
- Monitor campaign progress
- View success/failure metrics
- Collect response data

### 3. Webhook Integration

Revel8 uses real-time webhooks for seamless integration with external automation platforms:

**Testing webhooks:**
```bash
# Use the UI test button
Click "🔔 Test Webhook Toast" in the application

# Or use curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/webhook/make \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_type": "osint_complete",
    "data": {"target": "Company Inc"},
    "source": "make.com"
  }'
```

**Real-time notifications:**
- All webhook events appear as toast notifications in the UI
- Events are streamed via SSE for instant updates
- Supports multiple simultaneous connections

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend Configuration

The server exposes the following environment variables:

```bash
# Server settings
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000

# Make.com webhook URL (configured in server/api/v1/routes/target.py)
WEBHOOK_URL=https://hook.eu2.make.com/your-webhook-id
```

### Frontend Configuration

CORS origins are configured in `server/main.py`:

```python
allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:5173"]
```

### Ngrok Setup (Optional)

For exposing your local server to external webhooks:

```bash
cd server
./start_with_ngrok.sh
```

See `server/MAC_WEBHOOK_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.
